## 1 - Title page

Hi and welcome to my talk/demo

> General "about me"

This will be a quick demo of how easy it is to get started creating api microservices with Go

## 2 - Demo Header

This is my first live-coding demo so bear with me and wish me luck!

The API will create a few endpoints for a simple query and updating of data - and for no particular reason it’s based on characters from My Little Pony, because why not? :)

## 3 - Cardiff Go

Just a quick word about Cardiff Go

- Started around 4 years ago by Eleanor Deal
- Usually meet the first Thursday in every month for talks, workshops and socials
- Come along and see us! (we have dragon stickers!)

## 4 - Thank you & About me

Thanks for listening!

You can find me on twitter and github (where I’ll be publishing these slides and some handy references), and for totally unrelated artwork I’m also on instagram - I promise no selfies!

I’ll be publishing these slides and references later and they’ll be available via my twitter and devfest

I’ll be available throughout the day so feel free to come say hi if there’s anything you’d like to ask

And saying that (NEXT SLIDE)
